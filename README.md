# LIGHT-CONTROLLED-MOTOR
a light-controlled motor system using an
Arduino microcontroller board. The simplest design is to switch the motor on or off based on the presence or
absence of ambient light.The light signal is then detected by a photo-sensitive element (light-dependent resistor (LDR)) and converted back into an electrical signal that drives the motor and controls its speed.
